  io.kubewarden.policy.usage: |
    This policy works by inspecting `type` of `Service` resources and prevents the
    creation of Services with type `NodePort`.

    Kubernetes network policies have no control over what is being exposed
    via these type of Services. Because of that, it's usually a safer choice to have
    tighter control over the creation of these type of Services.

    # Configuration

    This policy doesn't take any configuration value.
